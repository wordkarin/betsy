two_true:
  order: one
  product: two
  quantity: 2
  shipping_status: true

three_true:
  order: two
  product: one
  quantity: 1
  shipping_status: true

# To show that you can not add more quantity than in the stock
four:
  order: three_pending

  quantity: 1
  shipping_status: false

# To show that you can not update the quantity if the order status is anything but pending. Can't use ones above because quantity would not be enough to add anything to the cart.
